# RS-CA — Rust Crate Archive

![RS-CA Logo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225779093?s=150&u=feece3c98dab5c6b62ac61919e76445c73e7b789&v=4)

**RS-CA** is a community project dedicated to preserving and maintaining important Rust crates that have been **abandoned** or **archived**.

---

## Purpose

- Keep vital crates available for the Rust ecosystem.
- Ensure repositories always have active maintainers with write access.
- Fix security issues and update dependencies.
- Keep older but important code working with newer Rust versions.

---

## What We Do

1. **Contact the original author** to request a repository transfer (when possible).  
2. If transfer isn’t possible, **hard fork** the repository.  
3. Maintain the crate under community stewardship.  
4. Archive the original version for historical reference.
