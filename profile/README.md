# RS-CA — Rust Crate Archive

![RS-CA Logo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225779093?s=150&u=feece3c98dab5c6b62ac61919e76445c73e7b789&v=4)

**RS-CA** is a community project that preserves and maintains important Rust crates that have been **abandoned** or **archived**.

---

## Purpose

- Keep vital crates available for the Rust ecosystem.
- Fix security issues and update dependencies.
- Make sure old but important code still works with new Rust versions.

---

## What We Do

1. **Contact the original author** (when possible) to transfer the repository.  
2. If transfer is not possible, **hard fork** the repository.  
3. Maintain the crate under community stewardship.  
4. Archive the original version for historical reference.

---

## Get Involved

If you know a crate that’s important but abandoned, open an issue or pull request.  

If you have open source contributions in Rust and a little time, why not join the org?
